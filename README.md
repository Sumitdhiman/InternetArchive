# Open in Archive.ph - Chrome Extension

## Overview

This Chrome extension allows users to quickly open the current webpage in [archive.today](https://archive.today) (also known as archive.is). It features a popup interface that displays the original and cleaned URL (query parameters and fragments removed) before opening the archived version. It also includes a "Buy Me a Coffee" link for support.

## Features

* **Popup Interface:** Clicking the extension icon opens a popup.
* **URL Cleaning:** Automatically removes URL query parameters (e.g., `?source=facebook`) and fragments (e.g., `#section`) before sending to archive.ph.
* **Displays URLs:** Shows both the original and the cleaned URL in the popup.
* **One-Click Archive:** Easily open the cleaned URL in archive.today
* **Support Link:** Includes a "Buy Me a Coffee" button.

    * In the file dialog, navigate to and select the `archiveph_extension` directory you created/downloaded.
    * Click "Select Folder".

5.  **Extension Ready:**
    * The "Open in Archive.ph" extension should now appear in your list of extensions and its icon should be visible in the Chrome toolbar.

## How to Use

1.  Navigate to any webpage you wish to archive (e.g., `https://example.com/article?ref=news`).
2.  Click the "Open in Archive.ph" extension icon in your Chrome toolbar.
3.  A popup will appear, showing:
    * **Original URL:** The full URL of the current page.
    * **Cleaned URL for Archive:** The URL with query parameters and fragments removed (e.g., `https://example.com/article`).
4.  Click the **"Open in Archive"** button in the popup.

6.  Optionally, you can click the "Buy Me a Coffee" button to support the developer.
